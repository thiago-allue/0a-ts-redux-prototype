/**
 * "Robots.txt Management in TypeScript"
 * 
 * This TypeScript module outlines the creation and control of a "robots.txt"
 * file, a key tool for instructing web-crawling bots on allowed site areas.
 * These instructions impact search engine indexing and site privacy.
 *
 * In the demonstrated example:
 * - "User-agent: *" means rules apply to all robots.
 * - "Disallow: " specifies no restrictions, thus all areas are accessible.
 */
User-agent: *   // The user-agent "*" targets all web robots.
Disallow:       // The empty "Disallow: " allows crawling for all pages.
