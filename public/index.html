/**
 * Title: Creating Initial Layout for React App through Index.HTML
 * 
 * The main HTML file named `index.htmL`, serves as the backbone for a React
 * application. It ensures application accessibility and an improved user 
 * interaction with meta tags, viewport for responsive design, and linking
 * the application's manifest for PWA support.
 * The placeholder %PUBLIC_URL% signifies the actual public URL linked during 
 * the build process. This URL can be a crucial aspect while developing or 
 * creating a production build.
 * Users disabling JavaScript are informed about the app's requirement for 
 * JavaScript with the `noscript` tag.
 * The `<div>` element with an ID "root" is important as it is the region where
 * the React application latches on.
